# SuguruAI: Product Requirements Document

## 1. Executive Summary

SuguruAI is an offline educational platform powered by Llama 2 large language model, designed to deliver personalized learning experiences based on the Ghana Educational System (GES) syllabus. The platform provides students with access to high-quality educational content through an interactive, video-like text interface that works completely offline, making it ideal for regions with limited internet connectivity.

**Key Objectives:**
1. Create an offline educational platform using Llama 2 LLM and the Ghana Educational System syllabus
2. Develop an engaging, interactive learning interface using Streamlit
3. Implement a sequential learning flow with sectioned content navigation
4. Complete the MVP development within 1 month

## 2. Product Vision

SuguruAI aims to revolutionize education in Ghana by leveraging AI technology to provide personalized learning experiences that are accessible without internet connectivity. The platform will serve as an educational companion that guides students through the GES syllabus using an interactive, engaging interface that mimics the flow of educational videos but in text format.
